## What is Hashman

Hashman is manager for NiceHash on Windows. It introduces automation on top of NiceHash that reacts to other GPU
activity on the target rig, for example gaming. Hashman detects when machine resources are idle and automatically starts
mining. If other apps contend with the GPU, Hashman will back off mining until resources are once again idle.
